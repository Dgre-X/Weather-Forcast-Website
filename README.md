# Weather-Forcast-Website
- I created a weather website using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. 👨‍💻   

- The website allows users to check the current weather conditions and forecasts for various locations.☁

- It features a responsive design for optimal viewing on different devices. 😎 

- The backend is powered by Node.js, which fetches weather data from an API and serves it to the frontend.

- The frontend is built using HTML and CSS, with dynamic updates using JavaScript to display weather information in a user-friendly format. 🤝 

- This project showcases my skills in frontend and backend development, as well as my ability to create interactive and visually appealing web applications. 📈
